# WayGO-ML

Repository for Machine Learning Waygo Apps

## About

WayGO-ML is a repository dedicated to developing machine learning applications for Waygo. It contains datasets, machine learning models, notebooks, and Flask applications.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **[Dataset](https://github.com/WayGo12/WayGoApp/blob/main/WayGo-ML/dataset)/**: This directory contains the machine learning datasets used for training and evaluation.
- **[Flask](https://github.com/WayGo12/WayGoApp/blob/main/WayGo-ML/flask)**: Here, you can find Flask applications that utilize machine learning models, as well as materials for integrating machine learning, cloud computing, and mobile development.
- **[Notebook](https://github.com/WayGo12/WayGoApp/blob/main/WayGo-ML/notebook)/**: This directory contains Jupyter Notebook files with machine learning code and experiments.
- **[Model](https://github.com/WayGo12/WayGoApp/blob/main/WayGo-ML/model)/**: The machine learning models are stored in this directory.
- **[requirements.txt](https://github.com/WayGo12/WayGoApp/blob/main/WayGo-ML/requirements.txt)**: It lists the Flask requirements for running the applications.
